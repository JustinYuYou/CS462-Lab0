5. Do you get the same result on both? Why or why not? 
No, I didn't get the same result. The default emits an error stating it's now allowed by channel policy and the new one didn't.
The reason is that the default one's policy doesn't allow the event, wherera the new one does.
6. What happens? Why?
It says the ECI is not found because the channel is deleted.
7. What do you observe? Why?
A json object of eid and one item of directives from the array is return. It is because the rule(hello_world) is evaluated and there is a function(send_directive) to send the event
8. What do you observe? Why? 
It returns an eid and empty array of directives. It is because there is no corresponding rule to send the directives.
10. Was there any difference? Why might the || operator be preferable in this use case? 
No, there was no difference. || operator is preferable in this case because we don't have to specify the name twice
